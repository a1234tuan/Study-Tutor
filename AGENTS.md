# NoteProject Engineering Guide

## Current Baseline

- Canonical open-source branch: `main`. The pre-publication history remains in the legacy repository on `feature/review-effect-coach-v2`.
- Product boundary: `docs/新的方案.md`.
- Database version: schema 19. Store definitions live in `src/db/reviewCoachSchema.ts`; schema 19 finalizes confirmed legacy facts and removes the six old Coach projection/execution tables.
- AI cockpit implementation is complete: Stages 0-8 were completed and verified on 2026-09-07, and Stage 9 automated release acceptance is complete. Physical-device upgrade and controlled real-account Firebase quota sign-off remain release gates; do not describe the release itself as signed off until they pass.
- Product UI migration is complete through final automated acceptance. `src/styles/visual-v2.css` is the active visual layer; `reading` is the default visual theme and `modern` is the alternative. The visual theme is device-local and independent from the existing light/dark/system setting; do not add it to the database or cloud-sync contract.
- The UI migration preserves formal create/save/rating semantics and routes Review Coach through `Review -> Learning Coach`. All caught errors rendered by React pages/components must pass through `src/lib/uiError.ts`; `src/lib/uiErrorSurface.test.ts` prevents raw `error.message` regressions.

## Review Coach Boundaries

- `RecordBlock.contentHtml` is the only editable source of decision-block content. `DecisionBlock` is an index, not a second content copy.
- Formal review-coach writes go through `src/features/reviewCoach/repository.ts`; cross-entity workflows belong in `orchestrator.ts`, not `useAppData.ts`.
- Projections must be rebuildable from formal facts. AI responses and local execution caches are not truth sources.
- Record-level FSRS remains responsible for whole-record scheduling. Decision-block facts must not silently rewrite FSRS state.
- Stage 3 added block feedback, immutable history, tombstones, queue enrollment, exclusion/restoration, analysis notes, and manual legacy-comment association.
- Stage 4 calls only the quick feedback interpreter and preserves original feedback.
- Stage 5 adds the manually confirmed deep-analysis workbench, validated `SessionBlueprint` creation, and deterministic current/waiting/deferred task scheduling.
- Stage 6 adds the dedicated adaptive review page, Blueprint-constrained turn generation, independent question quality review, answer evaluation, hint/skip/invalid/defer/abandon dispositions, and atomic answer/outcome commits.
- Stage 7 schedules delayed verification through deterministic local policy, requires fresh retrieval questions, records retained/decayed outcomes independently from record FSRS, rebuilds block/effect projections from formal facts, and applies aging plus a two-verification streak cap to task selection.
- Stage 8 makes schema 11/16 migration transactional and retryable, retains confirmed legacy quiz/KnowledgePoint facts and record-level comments without automatic block binding, syncs every formal entity and tombstone, archives losing decision-block content conflicts, strips prompts/raw provider responses/secrets at export boundaries, and removes old Coach runtime tables.
- Stage 9 adds deterministic Playwright coverage at desktop and Android-narrow viewports plus isolated Firebase Emulator acceptance for namespace rules, bounded incremental writes, no-op replay, interruption recovery, and revision-based clock-skew convergence.
- The post-Stage-8 cloud audit keeps AI prompts, device-local backup paths, and knowledge-podcast rows/audio outside cloud and portable exports; restore preserves those local values transactionally. Ordinary no-op sync skips the cloud lock, and large read/write plans require explicit confirmation.
- App initialization may refresh due verifications, but must not select or replace the current task. Startup-created verification tasks use IDs and queue timestamps derived from the verification fact so two devices produce identical sync hashes.
- Cloud review-event history is append-only until a checkpoint plus event-tombstone protocol is designed. Do not delete remote events merely because local retention compacts old logs.
- Stage 6 quick-model calls use strict JSON and explicitly disable thinking. Controlled real-provider acceptance may use `https://api.deepseek.com` with `deepseek-v4-flash`; never persist API keys in source, tests, docs, logs, screenshots, backup, or sync data.

## Cross-Cutting Checks

When changing decision-block or review-coach behavior, verify all affected paths:

- Dexie migration and repository invariants
- backup/restore and record-transfer round trips
- cloud-sync entity mapping and tombstones
- export privacy at cloud, ZIP, streaming, and native repository boundaries
- read/write quota estimates and no-op lock avoidance
- record deletion and mixed-record cleanup
- Desktop and Android narrow-screen interaction

## Verification

```powershell
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:firebase
npm run build
git diff --check
```

Use deterministic mocks in automated tests. Real AI providers are limited to explicit, controlled acceptance runs and must never replace deterministic CI coverage.

The final UI acceptance baseline is `119` Vitest files / `796` tests, `30` Playwright tests across Desktop and Android-narrow projects, and `3` isolated Firebase Emulator tests. Physical Android keyboard/IME, system back, image gestures, real DeepSeek, and controlled real-account Firebase quota checks remain manual release gates.

For local Stage 3 UI acceptance, run `npm run build`, start `npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4177`, and open `http://127.0.0.1:4177/?preview=stage3`. This localhost-only query seeds an isolated `BFS Stage3 Preview` record with an overdue review, block feedback, and an analysis-queue item; it is gated out of normal URLs and native shells.

For Stage 4 UI acceptance, use `http://127.0.0.1:4177/?preview=stage4`. It adds a deterministic completed quick-model interpretation with diagnostics and confirmation controls without contacting an AI provider.

For Stage 5 UI acceptance, use `http://127.0.0.1:4177/?preview=stage5`. It seeds deterministic eligible blocks, an OCR warning, a partial analysis result, and current/waiting/deferred tasks without contacting an AI provider.

For Stage 6 UI acceptance, use `http://127.0.0.1:4177/?preview=stage6`. It seeds a deterministic in-progress task with one displayed, quality-checked turn; hints, answer submission, skip, invalid-question reporting, defer, and abandon controls can be exercised without contacting an AI provider.

For Stage 7 UI acceptance, use `http://127.0.0.1:4177/?preview=stage7`. It seeds one in-progress delayed verification plus retained and decayed history, then rebuilds block and intervention-effect projections without contacting an AI provider.

For a combined Review Coach showcase, use `http://127.0.0.1:4177/?preview=coach`. It renders the dashboard, adaptive training, and delayed verification in a localhost-only preview shell. Its controls use deterministic in-memory behavior and do not mount cloud sync or contact an AI provider.
